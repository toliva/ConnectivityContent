# Booking Retrieval API Definition

## Introduction

Expedia provides a program interface for EQC partners to retrieve bookings made on any Expedia Inc. Points of sale. EQC partners can retrieve pending bookings (reservations, modifications, or cancellations) as frequently as they want.
If an EQC partner does not retrieve the booking information electronically, Expedia sends the information to the hotel by fax or email

## Booking Retrieval Request

The booking retrieval request message (BR RQ) allows EQC partners to retrieve bookings using different criteria:
* Retrieve pending bookings (reservations, modifications or cancellations that were not already retrieved)
* Retrieve a single booking by its booking ID
* Retrieve all the bookings that were created, modified, or cancelled in the past X days (X can be any number between 1 and 30)

Booking transactions (reservations, modifications, cancellations) are always made available for retrieval in sequence. A booking that has more than one transaction pending retrieval will only return the first booking transaction pending retrieval. As an example, for a booking that was initially created, then modified twice before any booking retrieval request is received:
1. The new reservation will be returned first
2. The “pending modification 1” will be returned with the next booking retrieval request
3. The “pending modification 2” will be returned with the 3rd booking retrieval request

Bookings that revert to fax or email cannot have their latest information requested through Expedia QuickConnect anymore.

## Booking Retrieval Response

The booking retrieval response message (BR RS) contains:
* 0 to 125 bookings. 125 is the maximum number of bookings that can be returned by Expedia QuickConnect in a single response message. If more than 125 bookings were found, the most recently created 125 bookings are returned. If a request was made for pending bookings, and more than 125 bookings were pending retrieval, a subsequent retrieval request will return the remaining bookings pending retrieval. If a request was made for all bookings made over the last X days and there were more than 125 bookings to return, it is currently not possible to retrieve all bookings but only the first 125 bookings created most recently.

OR

* An error message

### Booking Retrieval Response Types

A booking made on Expedia can evolve over time, as many times as needed, before the customer checks in to the hotel, or even in rare cases after the check-in date. For example, the booking could be changed to remove or add a day for the stay.
The booking can also be cancelled by the customer, or by Expedia customer support

#### New Reservation

A new booking or reservation contains all the information that the guest specifies while booking on one of Expedia points of sale. This information is at a minimum, the mandatory information in the BR RS message. On the other end, the maximum amount of information that can be found in a new reservation includes all the mandatory and optional elements, and it also includes repetitions of the elements that can be repeated (such as per day rate – up to 28 days, special requests – up to 6, reward programs – up to 2).

#### Modified Booking

A modified booking contains the latest information about the booking (whether new information, modified information or information that was on the original booking. A modified booking looks similar to a new one because it contains the same types of booking information, except that the “booking type” attribute of the “Booking” element is changed from “Book” to “Modify. 

Example of a booking element for a new booking:
```xml
<Booking id="324654" type="Book" createDateTime="2006-10-25T09:30:47Z" source="Expedia">
</Booking>
```
Example of a booking element for a new booking
```xml
<Booking id="44654" type="Modify" createDateTime="2006-10-27T11:33:19Z" source="Expedia">
</Booking>
```
#### Cancelled booking
A cancelled booking does not contain all information that can be found for a new or modified booking. It only contains the critical information required to cancel the booking in the hotel system. EQC partners should pay special attention to how they handle cancel messages.

The booking type identifies a cancelled booking:
```xml
<Booking id="4654" type="Cancel" createDateTime="2006-10-30T19:32:11Z" source="Expedia">
</Booking>
```
The booking message for cancellation contains the minimum set of mandatory information specified by the BR RS XML message but none of the optional information that may have been specified in the initial message, such as special requests, extra person fees, reward program or other. Some of the mandatory information included in the cancel message is set to 0:

Element / Attribute | Value
---|---
RoomStay@roomTypeId | 0
RoomStay@ratePlanId | 0
PerDayRate@baseRate	| 0.00
Total@amountAfterTaxes | 0.00
Total@amountOfTaxes	| 0.00
_Information set to zero in a cancel message_

In order to identify the booking to cancel in its system, the hotel should use the booking ID as the key. If this is not possible, the guest name and the dates of the stay should be identical to the latest version of the booking prior to the cancellation. 
To ensure the right booking is being cancelled the hotel should verify the booking ID as well as the guest name and the original check-in and check-out date of the booking.If any cancellation fee is due to the hotel, the amount to be charged is based on the hotel cancellation policy the partner currently has in place for the affected rate plan, as configured by the Expedia Market Manager. This fee is also chargeable to the Expedia VirtualCard number provided in the new or modified booking response that preceded the reservation cancellation and the card can be charged on the original arrival date.

## Error Handling
You may experience technical difficulties when developing and trying to connect to Expedia QuickConnect BR. This section addresses the most common errors and problems that an EQC partner might encounter.

### Network/System Communication Issues

There are many different error scenarios related to communication and authentication. Here are the possible scenarios, for any of the supported EQC APIs.

#### Connection Cannot Be Established
For many different reasons, attempting to connect to Expedia QuickConnect might not work. If the problem is:
- Connection timeout (before establishing connection)
- Cannot resolve host name
- Cannot establish connection

Before looking for assistance, the EQC partner should:
- Verify the URL used to connect to Expedia QuickConnect and make sure the address starts with https://
- Verify the domain name, and make sure that the address you are using is the right one for the environment you are targeting (do not try to send QA information to production, or vice-versa)
- If the EQC partner's system is behind a firewall, make sure that port 443 is opened for connection to Expedia's production environment (contact Expedia if you don't know what the URL to the production environment is)

It is also possible to fail to obtain a connection because Expedia QuickConnect servers cannot accept any more connections than the ones currently established to other EQC partners. In this case, the EQC partner will receive a communication error saying: Connection refused.

When this happens, the EQC partner should simply enter in retry mode.

#### SSL Certificate Validation Problems
EQC partners developing in Java should use version 1.4.2_13 or more recent to avoid issues with certificate signing authorities. If EQC partners prefer to keep using an older version of Java or in-house SSL libraries, they need to import the Entrust CA certificate.
- Entrust CA common name CN = Entrust.net Certification Authority (2048).
- To manually import the Entrust.net Certification Authority (2048) Certificate, download the CA certificate at https://www.entrust.net/downloads/root_request.cfm.


#### System errors retry recommendation

Whenever Expedia BR or BC return system errors (error code >= 4000), it is up to the EQC partner to decide what is preferable.

#### Connection Established, No Response

If the EQC partner's system manages to establish a connection to Expedia QuickConnect servers, but is not getting a response, the EQC partner should:
- Make sure that the EQC partner's system is not closing the connection too early. Some retrieval queries can take time, and Expedia will keep the connection active for up to 60 seconds. Therefore, the EQC partner should keep the connection open for at least 60 seconds.
- Make sure the content length specified in the HTTPS header corresponds to the actual length of the HTTPS request. If the length specified in the header is actually longer than the message itself, it results in Expedia QuickConnect waiting for bytes that never arrive, and eventually times out.
