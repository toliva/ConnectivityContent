# Quick Start

The Booking Notification API allows partners to receive new, modified or cancelled reservations in near real time, as Expedia customers make these bookings.

As this is a notification-based API, where Expedia initiates the notifications, partners interested in implementing this API need to contact Expedia to get started. It is possible to gain access to a test system that will generate booking notifications to the test endpoint of your choice.
