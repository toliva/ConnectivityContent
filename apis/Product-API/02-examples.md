## Multiple Properties Response
When using GET for multiple properties, additional parameters can be provided to navigate through the result set. By default, only 20 properties are returned at a time. Partners who have more than 20 properties assigned to their accounts and want to get through all their properties have to use offset and limit parameters.
For example, a partner wanting to get 3 results at a time would do this:
```HTTP
GET https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/products/v1/properties?offset=0&limit=3
```
The Product API will sort all properties assigned to this account by resourceId, ascending, and return the 3 lowest property resource ids.

Partners can then iterate through their properties by increasing the offset parameter. To get the next 3 properties, partners would issue a GET with offset=3, limit=3
```HTTP
GET https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/products/v1/properties?offset=3&limit=3
```
To get the next results, offset would become 6:
```HTTP
GET https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/products/v1/properties?offset=6&limit=3
```
