## Availability and Rates Request (AR RQ)
### AR RQ Schema Overview
Please note that this overview provides the most recent structure of EQC AR API (namespace http://www.expediaconnect.com/EQC/AR/2011/06). The API actually also supports the previous version of the schema (namespace http://www.expediaconnect.com/EQC/AR/2007/02), without the repeatable AvailRateUpdate element. The XSD file for the AR RQ API available on http://www.expediaquickconnect.com also supports both the old and new format under the new version.

2 | DateRange | - | | Specify dates on which availability and rate information provided in this message applies. A 'from' and a 'to' date must be specified. They can be equal if the EQC partner wants to update only one date. This element can be repeated more than once if EQC partner wants to update non-consecutive dates or date ranges. | “from date” <= “to date”
2 | @from | Date | | Start date of the interval (format: yyyy-mm-dd) | “From date” >= today – 1
2 | @to | Date | | End date of the interval (format: yyyy-mm-dd).  | “To date” <= (today + 2yrs + 1 day)
**Note:** The following 7 attributes are used to indicate on which day of the week, from the date range specified in the “from”-“to” attributes, the updates should be applied. If none of the 7 attributes are specified, updates will apply to all days of the week. As soon as one attribute is specified, the updates will only apply to the days where the attribute value is set to true.
If EQC partners need to use this feature, Expedia recommends specifying all 7 attributes, indicating on which day the updates should be applied (attribute value=true) and on which day the updates should not be applied (attribute value=false)
