# Sample Messages
This section contains sample messages illustrating how to interact with the Image API. Examples are currently not available, but will soon be added.

## Reading all Active Images
To read all active images, a GET of /images for the property will return them:
```
GET https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/properties/12933870/images
Accept: application/json
```

## Reading all Images (Active and Inactive)
To read all images, a query parameter needs to be passed to the GET images query:
```
GET https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/properties/12933870/images?status=all
Accept: application/json
```

```

    }
  ]
}
```
## Reading an Image Inactivated As a Duplicate
Expedia runs a periodic process that detects and inactivate duplicate images. When this happens, partners can find out by reading images and look for comments. 

```
GET https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/properties/12933870/images/e7b8c82b-b09f-4530-9626-31d94f218c2f
```

```
{
    "entity": {
        "resourceId": "e7b8c82b-b09f-4530-9626-31d94f218c2f",
        "publishedImageUrl": "https://images.trvl-media.com/hotels/13000000/12940000/12933900/12933870/e7b8c82b_b.jpg",
        "status": "Inactive",
        "state": "Published",
        "comments": [
            {
                "text": "AutoDedup: 24048236,24071654",
                "timestamp": "2016-08-25T08:13:00Z"
            }
        ],
        "lastUpdateDateTime": "2016-08-25T08:13:00Z",
        "originalImageUrl": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eps-website/IMG_0134.JPG"
    }
}
```
Please note that the numbers referenced in the comments are internal IDs, and Expedia will eventually replace them with the image public resource IDs to facilitate identifying the duplicates.


## Adding a New Image for a Property With Minimum Data
To add a new image to a property, only the image location is needed.
```
POST https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/properties/12933870/images
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
{
      "originalImageUrl": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eps-website/IMG_0134.JPG"
}
```

```

    "state": "Received"
  }
}
```

## Adding a New Image for Multiple Room Types
To add a new image to a property and have it assigned to some room types, an array of all the room types this image should be assigned to is needed. In this example, we assign a new image to 3 room types, using the room types resource IDs' found via the Product API.
```
POST https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/properties/12933870/images
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "categoryCode": "GUESTROOM_VIEW",
  "originalImageUrl": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eps-website/050.jpg",
  "roomTypes": [
    {
      "resourceId": 201357985,
      "roomTypeFeatured": false
    },
    {
      "resourceId": 201357986,
      "roomTypeFeatured": false
    },
    {
      "resourceId": 201603136,
      "roomTypeFeatured": true
    }
  ],
  "status": "Active"
}
```

```

    "state": "Received"
  }
}
```

## Verifying State of a Newly Added Image
To verify the state of a newly added image and make sure it gets published, a GET with the resource ID of the image will provide the information.

```
GET https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/properties/12933870/images/b3626ff5-f89f-45ed-9d64-0f0285a96015
Accept: application/json
```

```
{
  "entity": {
    "resourceId": "b3626ff5-f89f-45ed-9d64-0f0285a96015",
    "publishedImageUrl": "https://images.trvl-media.com/hotels/13000000/12940000/12933900/12933870/b3626ff5_b.jpg",
    "status": "Active",
    "state": "Published",
    "categoryCode": "GUESTROOM_VIEW",
    "roomTypes": [
      {
        "resourceId": 201357985,
        "roomTypeFeatured": false
      },
      {
        "resourceId": 201357986,
        "roomTypeFeatured": false
      },
      {
        "resourceId": 201603136,
        "roomTypeFeatured": true
      }
    ],
    "lastUpdateDateTime": "2016-08-24T15:05:00Z",
    "originalImageUrl": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eps-website/050.jpg"
  }
}
```

## Partially Updating An Existing Image (PATCH)

Here are a few examples of PATCH requests partners could want to make. Response examples are not included, but they would be the full image resource definition with all its fields, in its final state after the partial update.

### Updating only the status
```
{
	"status": "Inactive"
}
```

### Updating both the status and the category
```
{
	"status": "Inactive",
	"categoryCode": "INTERIOR_ENTRANCE"
}
```

### Overriding the current list of room types to only include a specific room type
```
{
	"roomTypes": [
		{
			"resourceId": 123,
			"roomTypeFeatured": true			
		}
	]
}
```

### Removing all the associated room types
```
{
	"roomTypes": []
}
```

## Deleting an Unpublished imnage
When partners upload images that Expedia cannot publish, it is possible for partners to ask Expedia to delete these to stop seeing them in the GET all images. Assuming a partner pushes a corrupted image with a POST:
```
 {
      "originalImageUrl": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eps-website/invalidimage.txt"
}
```
Expedia will return the resourceId for it straight away, with the received state:
```
{
    "entity": {
        "resourceId": "dcb9d144-2a5c-469c-a71c-e2f69c788e26",
        "state": "Received"
    }
}
```

The partner can then get state with a GET:

```
GET https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/properties/12933870/images/dcb9d144-2a5c-469c-a71c-e2f69c788e26
```
In this case, the state will be Rejected
```
{
    "entity": {
        "resourceId": "dcb9d144-2a5c-469c-a71c-e2f69c788e26",
        "status": "Active",
        "state": "Rejected",
        "lastUpdateDateTime": "2016-08-24T15:36:45.835Z",
        "originalImageUrl": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eps-website/invalidimage.txt"
    }
}
```

The partner can then issue a Delete statement to stop seeing this image completely for this property
```
DELETE https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/properties/12933870/images/dcb9d144-2a5c-469c-a71c-e2f69c788e26
Accept: application/json
```
The response when successful will be a 204 No Content.

## Invalid GET returning an error
Here's an example of how EPS Image returns errors to customers. If a partner provides an invalid resourceId:
```
GET https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/properties/12933870/images/notavalidresourceid
Accept: application/json
```
An error is returned
```
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": 3802,
            "message": "Invalid media GUID provided."
        }
    ]
}
```
