# API Definition
The Product API will enable our hotels partners to create and edit their room types and rate plans via APIs, without having to use EPC or contact their market manager. The API also enables our partners to read the definition of the room types and rate plans created in the system.

<a name="/authentication"></a>
## Authentication
Partner must include a valid username/password in the HTTP header of the request using the below format: 
```
Authorization: Basic <username and password encoded by Base64>
```
Example: 
```
Authorization: Basic RVFDdGVzdDEyOTMzODcwOmV3NjduazMz
```
Where "RVFDdGVzdDEyOTMzODcwOmV3NjduazMz" is the string "EQCtest12933870:ew67nk33" (username:password) Base64-encoded.

For more information about getting started for the first time, and authorization, please refer to the [FAQ & Guides section](guides.html#/howtogetstarted)

## Swagger.json File for Product API

To facilitate integrating with the Product API, Expedia offers a [Swagger.json](https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/products/swagger.json) file documenting the Product API model and operations. Please watch our [Video Tutorial](/apis/product-management/product-api/video.html) for more information on how developers can leverage this file to kick start development.

## API Principles & Standards

- **HTTP 1.1** : Our API only supports HTTP 1.1. Requests made with HTTP 1.0 explicitly will be denied.
- **JSON** : The service will return JSON documents for read, create, and update requests, and accept JSON payloads for create and update requests.
- **Secure HTTP w/TLS v1.2** : The API is only available via HTTPS, and supports GET (read), POST (create), and PUT (update) operations. Our API will not accept connections using SSL or TLS below v1.2 protocol. We will only establish connections with TLS v1.2 protocol.
- **REST** : The service adheres to REST principles and exposes three resources: Rate Plans, Room Types, and Properties.
- **MUST-IGNORE** : The service is constantly evolving and we expect consumers of our service to enforce a must-ignore policy. If the Product API starts returning additional data elements in responses, partners should ignore the data elements they do not need. Partners should also be able to serve the additional data back in an update request, as our update requests are full overlay, and failure to provide additional data back in update requests could cause data to be removed.
- **Entity** : All successful responses returned by EPS services are encapsulated within an HTTP Entity. Entity is used as a way to make successful responses generic across different resources and operations. The Entity element may represent a single object, or multiple objects; if the latter, it would be an array. 
- **Errors** : If a request produces one or more errors, the response will return an array of one or more errors. If Errors are present, Entity will not be present.

## Resources & Endpoints Overview
* All of Expedia APIs now live under the https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/ domain. API  users should make sure to only ever use the fully qualified domain name in their requests to our APIs, and never try to guess/hardcode the IP this address resolves to. In order to provide a robust, highly available and scalable solution, Expedia can change the IPs being used without notice.
* In order to access property information: `/products/properties/{propertyResourceId}`. Property resource ID is optional. If omitted, the list of active properties assigned to the account will be returned.
* Room types can be accessed in the context of a property: `/properties/{propertyResourceId}/roomTypes/{roomTypeResourceId}`. Room type resource ID is optional. If omitted, the list of active room types for the property will be returned.
* Rate plans can be accessed as part of a room type (they belong to a room type): `/properties/{propertyResourceId}/roomTypes/{roomTypeResourceId}/ratePlans/{ratePlanResourceId}`. Rate plan resource ID is optional. If omitted, the list of active rate plans for that room type will be returned.

<a name="/versioning"></a>
## Versioning

Expedia chose to version this API by making use of different content types per version. This gives Expedia the flexibility to version each resource (property, room type, rate plan) independently. 

Starting with version 2, it is now required to provide a content-type header including the version with any POST or PUT request. For example:

```
Content-Type: application/vnd.expedia.eps.product-v2+json
```

The Accept header also now indicates which version is expected to be returned. Accept header is optional. If ommitted, Expedia will default to return the latest version. If provided, Expedia will validate that the version requested for the response is a valid one. Example of a valid Accept header:

```
Accept: application/vnd.expedia.eps.product-v2+json
```

## HTTP Status Code

The API will leverage HTTP status codes as defined by RFC 2616, Section 10. More specifically, users should expect the following from the API: 

| Status Code | Meaning |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 200 | Success for read and update operations |
| 201 | Success for create operations |
| 204 | Success for delete operations |
| 400 | Errors induced by user due to incorrect input |
| 401 | Authentication error |
| 403 | Authorization error |
| 404 | Invalid resource |
| 405 | Invalid/unsupported method on resource |
| 406 | Unsupported media type for response (only application/vnd.expedia.eps.product-v2+json is supported) |
| 409 | Conflicting data |
| 415 | Unsupported media type for requests (only application/vnd.expedia.eps.product-v2+json is supported) |
| 500 | Internal system error (should not be retried) |
| 503 | Temporary internal system error (should be retried) |
| 504 | Timeout error (should be retried) |

## HTTP Headers
HTTP headers are slightly different between a request made to the EPS Product API, and responses returned.

### Format â€“ Request
| Header | Type | Required | Input Format |
| ------ | ---- | -------- | ------------ |
| Authorization | String | Required | Authorization: Basic [username:password encoded by Base64] |
| Content-Type | String | Required* | Content-Type: application/vnd.expedia.eps.product-v2+json |
| Accept | String | Required | Accept: application/vnd.expedia.eps.product-v2+json |
| Request-ID | String | Optional | Can be provided by the partner and can be referenced later on for troubleshooting purposes. When provided by the partner, it can be anything, and no validations will be performed to insure uniqueness of this ID. If it is not provided in request, API will generate a UUID and return it in the response.  |
*required for create and modify requests only

### Format â€“ Response
| Header | Type | Format |
| ------ | ---- | ------------ |
| Content-Type | String | Content-Type: application/vnd.expedia.eps.product-v2+json |
| Request-ID | String | Partner-provided request identifier. If it was not provided in the request, Expedia will generate a UUID and return it in the response |
| Transaction-ID | GUID | Unique transaction ID generated by Expedia for all messages. Expedia recommends storing this identifier. Can be used to reference messages when troubleshooting with Expedia |
| Location | String | Location: {url}  This header is only returned from create (POST) requests and contains the full URL to the newly created resource |

## Basic Response Wrapper Structure with Entity and Errors
All responses provided by the API will either contain an HTTP Entity element, which may represent a single object or an array of objects, or an Errors object for an array of errors. 

### Entity
The entities supported by the product API are rate plans, room types and properties.

The Entity approach allows partners to use the same wrapper for all resources exposed by the new generation of Expedia Partner Services like the EPS Product and EPS Image services. 

Consider the following code in Java:
```java
public class ResponseWrapperDTO<T> implements Serializable {
    private T entity;
    private List<ErrorDTO> errors;
}
```
Entities can be Product/RatePlan/RoomType/Property etc.
Simple entity response:
```JSON
{
  "entity": {
    "resourceId": 123,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Single Entity VS Entity Array in Read/GET Responses
There are two different read operations available against the Product API resources:
- To get a specific resource, the resource ID needs to be specified on the URL. For example: /products/properties/{propertyId}
- To get all the active resources in the system, omit the resource ID on the URL. For example: /products/properties/. 


For example, when requesting a single property, EPS Product API will return the property resource information as part of an Entity object:
```JSON
{
  "entity": {
    "resourceId": 1,
    ...
  }
}
```
When requesting all properties assigned to a user account, an array of properties is returned:
```JSON
{
  "entity": [
    {
      "resourceId": 1,
      â€¦
    }, {
      "resourceId": 2,
      â€¦
    }
  ]
}
```

### Errors
If a response doesnâ€™t contain an Entity, it will contain Errors:
```JSON
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 1000,
      "message": "Access denied: your account is not authorized to manage this property."
    }
  ]
}
```

<a name="/definitions/ErrorDTO"></a>
#### Error

Property Name | Type | Description
------------- | ---- | -----------
code | integer | [Full list of error codes](#/definitions/ErrorCodes).
message | string | 

### Entity vs Errors
Entity and errors are in the same wrapper because most frameworks will de-serialize responses automatically, but require a target type to which the response will be de-serialized.

Both successful and unsuccessful responses are returned by the same DTO, but can have either entity or errors, never both.

A Java implementation to handle this, using Springâ€™s RestTemplate, could look like this:
```java
   ResponseEntity<ResponseWrapperDTO<RoomTypeDTO>> response = restTemplate.exchange(
            "url",
            HttpMethod.POST,
            entity,
            new ParameterizedTypeReference<ResponseWrapperDTO<RoomTypeDTO>>() {});
```

### Modify an existing room type
Expedia offers 2 ways to modify a room type.

Using the PUT verb, partners can perform a full overlay change of the room type resource. It means that all elements of a room type need to be provided, and any optional element not provided will be erased/removed.

Using the PATCH verb, partners can perform a partial update of a room type. Expedia implemented the Merge-Patch RFC.

#### Room Type Modify - Partial Update (PATCH)

Expedia chose the merge-patch method for partial update, as described in [IETF RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).

This method allows partners to update a room type by providing only the fields/values they need to change. This saves partners from having to first read the room type before updating it. If partners provide the complete room type data, this method essentially behaves just like the [update](#modify-an-existing-room-type) method.

The response will always be the complete image of the room type after changes have been applied.

**Important**

The PATCH logic only applies to first (top) level elements/objects of the [room type](#/definitions/RoomTypeDTO). Partners can decide to include any number of these top level elements/objects, and any elements/objects not included will be ignored/untouched.  If a partner includes any array or complex object (such as name, age categories or max occupancy), these objects will need to be fully specified with all the desired elements/attributes/object changes, as they are treated as full overlay.

First-level elements/objects not provided in the input will remain unchanged. Some top-level elements can be removed. To do so, you have to explicitly specify it in the JSON message, as null. For array types, you need to provide a "null" or empty array value.

Also note that all validation rules are applied on the complete updated room type data. For instance, only providing a `ageCategories` that has no "Adult" category will yield the appropriate error response.

- Consumes: `application/vnd.expedia.eps.product-v2+json`
- Produces: `application/vnd.expedia.eps.product-v2+json`

## Room Type Rate Thresholds

Rate Thresholds defines the minimum and maximum acceptable amounts that can be pushed for a room night, under any rate plan of the room type. They are used to verify that the rate being pushed for the rate plans of this room are not abnormally low or abnormally high. Rate thresholds can only be read by partners, they cannot be set, changed or deleted.

Room type rate thresholds can be defined by Expedia in one of 2 ways: set by a manual override, or automatically calculated from the last 10 bookings made against any rate plan of the room type. By default, the automatic method is used. Thresholds will not be returned until at least 10 reservations were made, so it is expected that newer room types will have no room type thresholds defined. When no room-specific thresholds exist, Expedia defaults to global thresholds not exposed via this API.

### Modify an existing rate plan

Expedia offers 2 ways to modify a rate plan. 

Using the PUT verb, partners can perform a full overlay change of the rate plan resource. It means that all elements of a rate plan need to be provided, and any optional element not provided will be erased/removed.

Using the PATCH verb, partners can perform a partial update of a rate plan. Expedia implemented the Merge-Patch RFC.

<a name="/PatchRatePlan"></a>
#### Rate Plan Modify - Partial Update (PATCH)

Expedia chose the merge-patch method for partial update, as described in [IETF RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).

This method allows partners to update a rate plan by providing only the fields/values they need to change. This saves partners from having to first read the rate plan before updating it. If partners provide the complete rate plan data, this method essentially behaves just like the [update](#modify-an-existing-rate-plan) method.

The response will always be the complete image of the rate plan after changes have been applied.

**Important**

The PATCH logic only applies to first (top) level elements/objects of the [rate plan](#/definitions/RatePlanDTO). Partners can decide to include any number of these top level elements/objects, and any elements/objects not included will be ignored/untouched.  If a partner includes any array or complex object (such as cancel policy, additional guest amounts or distribution rules), these objects will need to be fully specified with all the desired elements/attributes/object changes, as they are treated as full overlay.

First-level elements/objects not provided in the input will remain unchanged. Some top-level elements can be removed. To do so, you have to explicitly specify it in the JSON message, as null. For array types, you need to provided a "null" or empty array value.

Also note that all validation rules are applied on the complete updated rate plan data. For instance, only providing a `travelDateStart` that is after the current `travelDateEnd` will yield the appropriate error response.

Also contain the IDs and Codes that need to be mapped to push avail/rates and identify the right rate plans in booking messages. When a rate plan has a single Distribution Rule with Distribution Model set as HotelCollect, the rate plan will only be sold as HotelCollect and the property is expected to collect the payment at the time customers check in. When a rate plan has a single Distribution Rule with Distribution Model set to ExpediaCollectm it indicates that this rate plan will be sold as ExpediaCollect and the property will collect payment from Expedia. If two distinct Distribution Rules are set, one for ExpediaCollect, one for HotelCollect, it indicates that the rate plan can be sold as either ExpediaCollect or HotelCollect. In this case, only one of them can be used to manage avail/rate but both can be used in booking messages, to indicate which option (ExpediaCollect or HotelCollect) the customer selected. Any other combination of distribution rules cannot exist. For properties that participate in the ExpediaTravelerPreference (ETP) program, it is required for all their standalone rate plans to support both ExpediaCollect and HotelCollect.
