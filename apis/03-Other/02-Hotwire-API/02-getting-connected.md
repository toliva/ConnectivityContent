## Hotwire QuickConnect: Registration Process

To register for an API key and get approved as a developer to begin using the Hotwire QuickConnect interface, follow these steps: 

1) Contact hqc@hotwire.com in order to request a Hotwire QuickConnect API key.

2) At this time we also need to be notified of the IPs you will be using for testing so we can make our test server available. 
We will respond once your key has been approved, it will then be available for immediate usage.

API Key is per developer partner. Once your key has been activated you can use the same key for all hotels that are a part of your system. 
We do NOT require a seperate API key per hotel.
