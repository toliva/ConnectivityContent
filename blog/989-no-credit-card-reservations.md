On December 11th, we introduced a new test feature called **“Bookings without a credit card”** allowing a few selected properties to accept **same-day** and **next-day** Hotel Collect reservations without credit cards on Expedia.com. The feature will be available on Hotels.com beginning of next year.

This new feature could help **boost their last-minute reservations** by making it easier for travelers to reserve a room without a credit card. We’ve activated this great feature for a few selected properties to allow them to test the new functionality and fill rooms they may otherwise not sell in such a short period of time. 

For you to **identify a Booking without a credit card**, the below note will be displayed in the payment instructions: *“This guest booked without a credit card and will pay upon arrival. Be sure to reconcile this reservation and waive the cancellation fee to avoid paying unnecessary compensation if the guest cancels or does not show up.”*

If a property contacts you to opt-out to this feature, please ask them to reach out to their Expedia account manager.
