Here at Expedia Group, we’re proud to have one the strongest brand families in the travel industry. After all, we’ve spent countless hours meticulously crafting each brand and its reputation. But to maintain our position in the industry, it’s important that our brands’ visual and written identities are consistent, whether they appear on our own site or in a connectivity partner’s brochure.   

To help you use our brands correctly when displaying them alongside their own, we’ve developed a new set of brand guidelines. 

**About the guide**
Our new guide outlines each of our brand’s look and feel, values, and personality to help you maintain their identity. Along with the guide, we’ve also created a toolkit of logo assets, so you’ll never have to use a low-resolution image again!

If you have any questions about the guide, please reach out to your account manager.
