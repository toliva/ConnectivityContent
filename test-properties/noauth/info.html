    <p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                Once you find your test hotel, verify that the check in / check out dates, number of rooms, number
                of adults and number of children have the desired values

    </p>
    <p>
        To complete the booking, you will need to enter a valid form of payment which will be charged if you chose
        the Pay Now option on the previous page.
        Your booking will be refundable based on the cancelation policy for that rate plan (You can see the
        cancelation policy for each rate plan in Partner Central - Rooms and Rates - Rooms, Rates and Policies).
        Here are the mandatory items needed to complete the booking.
        <ul>
            <li>First/Last Name;</li>
            <li>Phone #;</li>
            <li>Cardholder name;</li>
            <li>Debit/Credit Card #;</li>
            <li>Expiration date of the card, security code and ZIP code;</li>
            <li>Email address.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>A booking confirmation will be delivered to the email you entered, and that email will also include a link
        for canceling the booking.</p>
    <p>At this point, we recommend that you create an account. Once you create an account, you can find all your
        bookings under the "My Trips" section which may make it easier to cancel all test bookings.</p>

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>: For how long I can use the test property.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A</strong>: The test property will be assigned to your account for 2 weeks. You can extend the
        period for additional 2 weeks, after you assign a test property to your account.
        Do the following to extend the period (make sure you do this before the "Valid To" date):
        <img src="/images/test-properties/info-extend.png" />
        After the 2 weeks / 4 weeks, you will no longer be able to use the property, but you can still log in to
        the self-service tool and assign new property.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>: My property shows as sold out. What should I do?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A</strong>: You have to ensure that the property have at least one active room type by having at
        least one active Standalone rate plan.
        If yes, you have to ensure that for this room type and rate plan, there are no restrictions applied for the
        period you are trying to make reservation and more important, there is inventory and rates loaded for the
        same period.
        To verify this, log in to <a href="https://www.expediapartnercentral.com/">Partner Central</a> and use
        Rooms, Rates and Policies & Manage Rates and Availability under Rooms and Rates drop down.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>: Mistakenly I booked a non-refundable Expedia Collect reservation. Can I request refund?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A</strong>: Prior booking, it is important to check the cancelation policy of the rate plan and
        ensure that you are booking refundable rate plan.
        However, if you mistakenly booked non-refundable reservation, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:eqcss@expedia.com">eqcss@expedia.com</a>
        and we will initiate refund.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>: Can Expedia provide me with a test Credit/Debit Card (CC)?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A</strong>: No, Expedia does not provide test CC. For Expedia Collect reservations, you must use
        real CC with enough funds.
        For Hotel Collect reservations, you can use dummy card as we do not validate the CC for this type of
        reservations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>: I just pushed Availability and Rates, but I don't see it updated on the live site.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A</strong>: The update will reflect immediately in Partner Central, however due to our caching, for
        the rate on the live site, it might take up to 30 minutes to update.
        Note: The rate on the Check-out page (the last page during the booking process) should update immediately.
